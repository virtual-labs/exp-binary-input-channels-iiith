      "question": "Consider a binary erasure channel with parameter $\\epsilon=0.3$ (denoted by $BEC(0.3)$). Suppose that a $n$-length vector, $\\boldsymbol{x}\\in\\mathbb{F}_2^n$, is transmitted through this channel. Which of the following is correct? ",
      "answers": {
        "a": "An erasure at the first position increases the probability of getting an erasure in the second position.",
        "b": "The event that $i$ of the $n$ bits are erased has higher probability than the event that $j$ bits are erased, if $j>i$",
        "c": "Bits can be flipped or erased in $\\boldsymbol{x}$.",
        "d": "Exactly $0.3n$ bits will be erased in $\\boldsymbol{x}$.",
        "e": "None"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect answer. The channel models we consider in this lab are all memoryless channels, i.e., noise in each transmitted symbol is independent of noise in other symbols.",
        "b": "Correct Answer! The probability that $i$ bits are erased is $P(i)=\\binom{n}{i}0.3^i\\times 0.7^{n-i}$. If $i<j$, $P(i)>P(j)$.", 
        "c": "Incorrect answer. There are no bit flips possible in the $BEC$ channel model.",
        "d": "Incorrect answer. There is no guarantee that exactly $0.3n$ bits will be erased, simply because the probability of each bit getting erased is $0.3$.",
        "e": "Well, one of them is the correct answer."

      "question": "Consider that we are transmitting some $n$-length bit vector $\\boldsymbol{x}$ through a binary symmetric channel with bit flip probability $p=0.9$. What is the probability that exactly the first half of the bits in $\\boldsymbol{x}$ are flipped?",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. There is a non-zero probability that this event can happen.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Observe that the question is giving exactly which of the bits are getting flipped.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Observe that the question is giving exactly which of the bits are getting flipped, and calculate the probability carefully. ",
        "d": "Correct! We know that each bit is flipped with probability $0.9$, and any bit is not flipped with probability $0.1$, We have the answer $0.9^{n/2}\\times 0.1^{n/2}$ as the right option. Note that there is no binomial coefficient here, as the question specifies exactly which positions are getting flipped."

        "a": "Wrong answer. Note that the bit flip probability is $0.3$. Thus, fewer bit errors occur with higher probability than larger number of bit errors.",
        "b": "Wrong answer. Note that the bit flip probability is $0.3$. Thus, fewer bit errors occur with higher probability than larger number of bit errors.",
        "c": "Correct answer! Vectors (1) and (3) are two bit flips away from the input vector, whereas (2) is just a single bit flip away. Thus, the probabilities of getting either (1) (or (3)) from the given input sequence is $0.3^2\\times 0.7^2$, whereas (2) occurs with probability $0.3\\times 0.7^3$, given that the input sequence is $(0,1,0,1)$",

        "a": "Note that we have to compare the two probabilities $p(\\boldsymbol{y_1}|\\boldsymbol{x})$ and $p(\\boldsymbol{y_2}|\\boldsymbol{x})$, and find out which one is higher. By the expression of $p(\\boldsymbol{y_i}|\\boldsymbol{x})$, we have to find which value among $\\sum_{j=1}^3(y_{i,j}-x_j)^2$ for $i=1,2$ is smallest. Now, $\\sum_{j=1}^3(y_{1,j}-x_j)^2=0.3^2+0.1^2+0.3^2=0.19$ and $\\sum_{j=1}^3(y_{2,j}-x_j)^2=0.4^2+0.2^2+0.1^2=0.21$.
