      "question": "This is a question on the binomial distribution. Consider the experiment in which 10 lights are independently and random switched on, each with some probability $p\\in(0,1)$. Which of the following describes the probability of seeing exactly $4$ lights on, after this random experiment? (note that $\\binom{n}{k}$ refers to the binomial coefficient.",

        "a": "Incorrect Answer. It is true that there are $\\binom{10}{4}$ ways to switch on exactly $4$ of the $10$ lights. Do check the probability of getting one such configuration, which seems to be the source of your error.",
        "b": "Correct Answer! There are $\\binom{10}{4}$ ways to switch on exactly $4$ of the $10$ lights, each possible way is obtained with probability $p^4(1-p)^6$", 
        "c": "Incorrect answer. You have to account for the number of ways to pick the possible configurations of having $4$ of the lights on, and the remaining $6$ off, first. Then, calculate the probability of each such configuration (recall that you have to account for the lights which are off also, in this calculation).",
