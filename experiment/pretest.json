      "question": "Consider the following question on the binomial distribution. In an experiment, $10$ lights are independently and randomly switched on, each with a probability $p \\in (0,1)$. Which of the options best describes the probability of observing exactly $4$ lights on after this random experiment? (note that $\\binom{n}{k}$ refers to the binomial coefficient.)",

        "a": "Incorrect Answer. There are indeed $\\binom{10}{4}$ ways to switch on exactly $4$ of the $10$ lights. However, there may be an error in calculating the probability of achieving one of these configurations. Please review the approach to ascertain where the discrepancy lies.",
        "b": "Correct Answer! Indeed, there are $\\binom{10}{4}$ ways to switch on exactly $4$ of the $10$ lights, each possible way is obtained with probability $p^4(1-p)^6$.", 
        "c": "Incorrect answer. In this analysis, initially consider the number of ways to select the possible configurations with four lights on and the remaining six lights off. Subsequently, compute the probability of each specific configuration. This calculation must also factor in the configurations for the lights that remain off.",
