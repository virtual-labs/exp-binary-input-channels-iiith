### Procedure

The experiment consists of three sub-experiments, through which the user will be systematically understand the essential mathematical aspects of three important probabilistic channels, discussed in the theory part of this experiment. These channels are : 

1. The Binary Erasure Channel, which erases each bit transmitted independently with probability $\epsilon$. The erasure symbol is denoted by $?$. 
2. The Binary Symmetric Channel, which flips the bit transmitted independently with probability $p$. 
3. The Additive White Gaussian Channel, which adds a real and independent noise value (sampled from a Gaussian distribution with $0$ mean and variance $N_0/2$). 

The detailed working of this experiment is as follows.
